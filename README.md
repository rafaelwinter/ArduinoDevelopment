ArduinoDevelopment
===========

Arduino development study projects.

1. LedControl
----

This project has a blinking LED that can be activated with a push button. 
The blinking speed is controlled by a potentiometer. 

A [Fritzing diagram](http://fritzing.org/download/) can be found with the code.

2. LedAnalogVoltage
----

This project lights up a row of LEDs according to the position of a potentiometer. It is a contribution of [@VitorRodrigues](https://github.com/VitorRodrigues).

A [Fritzing diagram](http://fritzing.org/download/) can be found with the code.

3. KEYES 5050 module test 
----

This sketch shows how to control a KEYES 5050 Full-color LED Module for Arduino. It lights up one LED at time sequentially, moving it forward and backwards. The colors are changed in the sequence, in each step of the sequence an interpolation is done between colors of the rainbow.

Parts used:

* 1x Arduino. I used a DCCduino Nano (a clone), but any Arduino with sufficient pins would work.
* 1x KEYES 5050 Full-color LED Module for Arduino.
* Protoboard 
* Lots of jumpers...
